Domestic pigs and wild boar affected.The first reported case involved wild boar mortality. Following the death of wild boar in Kinabatangan (which tested negative with conventional PCR by Sabah Department of Veterinary Services Laboratory), the disease investigation was extended to the neighboring district, where the first case of mortality involving backyard pigs in Pitas was reported. After the laboratory confirmation, the surveillance was intensified and extended to other districts encompassing the 50 km radius from the index case. The Sabah Wildlife Department reported on the wild boar mortality in Beluran district, where samples were taken and found positive for African swine fever. Surveillance then expanded outside the containment zone to cover the whole Sabah State. Currently, surveillance is conducted and intensified in the whole country.Four outbreaks on backyard farms were recorded, affecting 212, 7, 78, and 6 domestic pigs respectively.

Such a sighting is not happening anymore since ASF hit Sabah. (Photo by Rudi Delvaux).KOTA KINABALU: The African Swine Fever (ASF) is not getting enough attention despite the disease having decimated the domestic and wild pigs population in Asia, Europe, and Africa, say wildlife experts.Prof Erik Meijaard, former chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Wild Pigs Specialist Group, and Prof Benoit Goossens of Cardiff University, said the near-100% fatality rate threatens food security, ecosystems and the lives and traditions of millions of people.Meijaard warned in a recent letter he authored in the journal Science that this socio-ecological disaster was currently overlooked and receiving insufficient attention.‚ÄúASF has devastated pig populations in Asia since 2018, but the impacts are especially significant on the island of Borneo,‚Äù he said in a statement on Friday (Jan 19).‚ÄúASF has led to local population crashes of bearded pigs, once the most numerous large mammal species on the island, of up to 100%.‚ÄúThis decline may render the species critically endangered, an international conservation status verging on extinction,‚Äù he added.Goossens, who co-authored the letter, said that bearded pigs played an essential role in ecosystem maintenance and socio-cultural practices.He said the once numerous pigs played an important role in steering ecological processes in Borneo‚Äôs tropical forest.‚ÄúLocal hunting studies indicate that bearded pigs constituted up to 81% of hunted wildlife weight in some villages, while Malaysia‚Äôs Sarawak once harvested up to a million bearded pigs each year.‚ÄúHow can the loss of such an integral species be overlooked?‚ÄúEspecially when there is no evidence indicating that wild pig populations in Borneo, or other South-East Asian islands can fully recover,‚Äù added Goossens, who is also the director of research outfit Danau Girang Field Centre in Sabah.Sabah Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Seri Dr Jeffrey Kitingan had in April last year said the ASF, which was first detected in Sabah in February 2021, was subsiding but that the state was still in the recovery phase.Kitingan said veterinary officials were monitoring the situation to ensure no new cases were detected in the state‚Äôs pig farms.The state Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry Minister also said 20 districts were affected by the ASF disease and all the districts remained in recovery as of Aug 31, 2022.He said the ban on wild boar hunting would also remain until Sabah was free from ASF.In May last year, the Bring Back Our Rare Animals (Bora) movement reported that the wild boar population was making a healthy recovery in the Tabin conservation area in the east coast.But the ASF has been detected in several countries including Singapore, Hong Kong and Philippines last year.Goossens said while ongoing clinical trials to develop an effective vaccine against ASF were showing positive results, he pointed out this was mostly relevant for domestic pigs.‚ÄúVaccinating wild pigs would require a whole different setup, such as oral vaccination with baits, which is far from being ready.‚ÄúAlso, baiting wild pigs across Borneo would be logistically, hugely complex and expensive to implement,‚Äù he said.Both Meijaard and Goossens stressed that something needed to be done urgently.‚ÄúFailing to acknowledge the socio-economic significance of the virus in low-income demographics, such as the indigenous tribes of Borneo, could result in the irreversible loss of species and the ecosystems, cultures, livelihoods, and communities they support to implement,‚Äù they said.They had called for urgent research and interventions, with the participation of rural communities, focusing on preventing the spread of ASF to other regions where people fundamentally depend on pigs.Thank you for your report!Copyright ¬© 1995-                                                $(document).ready(function () {                         var theDate = new Date();                        $('#spanCopyright').text(theDate.getFullYear())                    })                 Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]Best viewed on Chrome browsers.We would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

Ketua Pengarah JPV, Datuk Dr Norlizan Mohd Noor berkata, pengesanan penyakit itu ekoran penyiasatan dijalankan JPV susulan laporan penternak babi terbabit serta pengesahan sampel diuji di Makmal Veterinar Sepang pada 20, 22 dan 23 Disember. Beliau berkata, justeru, JPV mengambil langkah awal dan proaktif bagi mengawal dan membasmi penularan penyakit ASF antaranya mengeluarkan Notis Perintah Kuarantin ke atas ladang babi di kawasan Paya Mengkuang dan ternakan tidak dibenarkan keluar atau masuk kawasan terjangkit. Pemusnahan semua babi di ladang terjangkit berdasarkan Seksyen 19 Akta Binatang 1953 (Pindaan 2013) dan ternakan di ladang disahkan bebas jangkitan dibenarkan untuk penyembelihan di rumah sembelih diluluskan sahaja. Tetapi karkas dan daging babi tidak dibenarkan dibawa keluar ke negeri lain. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Selain itu, syarat pindah ternakan babi dan produk babi di seluruh Semenanjung Malaysia diperketatkan serta pemantauan, pemeriksaan klinikal dan persampelan semua ladang babi di kawasan terjangkit serta ladang babi di seluruh negara dipergiatkan, katanya dalam kenyataan, di sini, hari ini. Beliau berkata pemantauan serta persampelan dipergiatkan di semua rumah sembelih babi di seluruh negara. Katanya, semua penternak babi dinasihatkan supaya tidak memberi haiwan berkenaan makanan sisa dapur (swill feeding) dan tidak membuang bangkai babi ke dalam sungai, kolam, kebun dan sebagainya.;Error

Ketua Pengarah Veterinar, Datuk Dr Norlizan Mohd Noor, berkata babi itu membabitkan 19 ladang dari 35 ladang ternakan yang dikesan menghidap penyakit itu di Paya Mengkuang. Menurutnya, baki 3,000 babi lagi yang dijangkiti virus itu akan dimusnahkan dalam masa terdekat bagi mengelak penularan yang lebih serius. Dijangkakan sehingga minggu ketiga (minggu depan) sebanyak 16,000 akan dimusnahkan. Usaha untuk memusnahkan haiwan ini bukanlah suatu perkara yang mudah kerana ia dilakukan dengan teliti membabitkan yang positif dijangkiti virus berkenaan, katanya ketika sidang media di sini, hari ini. Yang turut hadir, Pengarah Bahagian Regulatori DVS, Dr Mohamad Razali Abdul Razak. Sebelum ini media melaporkan, kes ASF dikesan di tujuh ladang babi di Paya Mengkuang, Melaka pada penghujung Disember tahun lalu. Dr Norlizan berkata, setakat ini terdapat 456 ladang babi di seluruh negara membabitkan 1.4 juta ekor babi. Menurutnya, DVS melaksanakan pemusnahan babi di ladang terjangkit berdasarkan Seksyen 19, Akta Binatang 1953 (Pindaan 2013). DVS mendapat kerjasama daripada beberapa jabatan dan agensi kerajaan termasuk pihak berkuasa tempatan (PBT) di Melaka. Penyakit bawaan babi itu tidak menjangkiti manusia sebaliknya, ia hanya membabitkan haiwan berkenaan sahaja dan haiwan yang dijangkiti masih boleh dimakan dengan syarat dagingnya perlu dimasak dengan menggunakan suhu kepanasan melebihi 60 darjah celcius, katanya.;Error

Timbalan Menteri Pertanian dan Industri Makanan I Datuk Seri Ahmad Hamzah berkata, sehingga semalam sebanyak tujuh ladang disahkan positif penyakit ASF dengan jumlah 5,438 babi. Katanya, DVS Negeri Melaka melakukan siasatan pada 18 Disember menerusi pemeriksaan post-mortem ke atas babi mati dan sampel organ dihantar ke Makmal Veterinar Zon Tengah, Salak Tinggi untuk pengesahan penyakit. Menurutnya, pada 20 Disember lalu, keputusan makmal mendapati babi berkenaan disahkan positif penyakit ASF. Tindakan sudah dan sedang dan akan dilaksanakan oleh pihak DVS bagi membendung, mengawal dan membasmi rebakan penyakit ASF termasuk notis di bawah Seksyen 18(2) Akta Binatang 1953 (Akta 647) yang dikeluarkan kepada pemilik ladang-ladang babi terbabit. Justeru pemindahan ternakan tidak dibenarkan keluar daripada kawasan itubagi membolehkan DVS menjalankan pemeriksaan dan ujian penyakit berkuatkuasa mulai 20 Disember 2021. Bagi ladang yang disahkan positif penyakit ASF, tindakan pemusnahan semua ternakan akan dijalankan oleh DVS. Sementara bagi ladang-ladang lain, ternakan babi yang sihat dibenarkan untuk disembelih di rumah sembelih Paya Mengkuang setelah pemeriksaan dilakukan, katanya pada majlis bantuan banjir di Lubok China pada hari ini. Walau bagaimanapun daging babi terbabit hanya dibenarkan untuk kegunaan negeri Melaka sahaja dan tiada karkas dibenarkan keluar ke negeri lain. Ahmad berkata, penyiasatan dan pemantauan lanjut di kawasan Paya Mengkuang sedang dijalankan bagi mengekang rebakan ASF. Menurutnya, terdapat 35 ladang babi komersil dengan 26penternak di Paya Mengkuang dengan jumlah populasi terkini membabitkan41,913 ekor. Dalam masa sama DVS juga menjalankan pemeriksaan dan persampelan ke atas semua 35 buah ladang di mana semua sampel yang diambil (darah atau organ) telah dihantar ke Makmal Veterinar Zon Tengah, Salak Tinggi untuk pengesahan penyakit. Beliau berkata, penyakit ASF tidak zoonotic dan tidak berjangkit kepada manusia, ia hanya boleh menjangkiti babi yang diternak atau babi hutan. Sehubungan itu, orang ramai dinasihatkan tidak panik, dan bagi yang mahu memasakbabi perlu pada suhu tinggi (melebihi 80oC) dalam tempoh yang lama (melebihi 20 minit) untk mematikan virus. Kerjasama orang awam dimohon supaya melaporkan segera sebarang kematian pada babi hutan kepada Pejabat Perkhidmatan Veterinar Daerah (PPVD) atau Pejabat Perkhidmatan Veterinar Negeri Melaka. #kw.

Menurut MAQIS, sosej daging babi seberat 10 kilogram yang dianggarkan bernilai RM350 itu dirampas daripada lelaki warga China yang meletakkannya dalam bagasi tangan. Beberapa sampel telah diambil daripada sosej daging babi berkenaan untuk diuji di Makmal Kesihatan Awam Veterinar dan hasil ujian makmal mendapati sosej itu positif untuk pengesanan penyakit ASF, kata MAQIS dalam kenyataan hari ini. Menurut MAQIS prosedur ujian itu dilakukan bagi mencegah penularan wabak penyakit dan dikhuatiri jika tidak dikawal boleh menyebabkan industri ternakan babi negara terjejas. Semua sosej yang dirampas akan dilupuskan mengikut prosedur operasi piawaian yang telah  ditetapkan, katanya. Malaysia mengenakan larangan membawa masuk produk babi dari negara yang mengalami wabak penyakit ASF termasuk penumpang di laluan udara yang membawa bagasi tangan bagi menghalang risiko kemasukan penyakit itu. Menurut MAQIS penyakit ASF mudah merebak dan mampu menyebabkan kadar kematian yang sangat tinggi hingga 100 peratus babi peliharaan yang boleh melumpuhkan industri ternakan babi dalam masa yang singkat. ‚Äì BERNAMA;Error

Exco Pertanian dan Industri Makanan Negeri Sembilan Datuk Bakri Sawir berkata, kes positif itu dikesan selepas sampel dua ekor babi diambil daripada 275 ekor haiwan itu di ladang berkenaan Khamis lalu. Sampel itu telah diambil semalam (Jumaat) dan disahkan positif ASF pada petangnya. Tindakan segera telah pun diambil dengan menyita ladang berkenaan selain meminta bantuan polis memantau kawasan membabitkan radius lima kilometer supaya tiada pergerakan keluar masuk, katanya ketika ditemui di lokasi pada Sabtu. Ujarnya, terdapat 20 ladang ternakan babi tidak berlesen di kawasan berkenaan dan kerajaan sebelum ini sudah mengeluarkan notis supaya menghentikan aktiviti itu. Penternak diminta menghentikan segera aktiviti penternakan tanpa lesen. Kita tidak mahu mengambil tindakan keras tetapi apabila berlaku kes begini kita perlu tegas. Penyakit daripada babi seperti virus nipah sudah pernah berlaku di Port Dickson pada tahun 1999 melibatkan lebih 100 kematian ternakan itu. Adakah kita mahu ia berulang, katanya. Sehubungan itu katanya, kerajaan negeri akan mengambil tindakan tegas mengikut undang-undang yang ada termasuk tindakan merobohkan kandang yang mempunyai kes positif ASF.   Bakri menambah, babi yang dikesan positif ASF itu dipercayai dibawa masuk dari Perak dan ASF tidak boleh menjangkiti manusia namun jika tidak dikawal ia boleh menjangkiti binatang lain.

Menurutnya, pada 20 Jun, pihaknya  mengesan beberapa ekor babi hutan mati di kawasan itu dan mengambil sampel untuk dibuat ujian. Hasil ujian mendapati kematian babi itu disebabkan ASF dan sehingga 30 Jun, sebanyak 91 babi hutan mati di sekitar kawasan hutan terbabit. Kita percaya penyakit itu menular dipercayai berpunca daripada aliran air dan bawaan makanan daripada haiwan dari Taman Negara Jerantut, katanya. Dr Anum berkata, sebagai menyelesaikan penularan penyakit itu, pihaknya bekerjasama dengan Jabatan Perlindungan Hidupan Liar Dan Taman Negara (Perhilitan) dengan melakukan pemantauan sekitar jarak 10 kilometer daripada lokasi penyakit itu dikesan. Kita turut melupuskan kesemua babi terbabit dengan menanam haiwan itu termasuk proses nyah kuman, katanya. Katanya, ASF disebabkan virus bawaan kutu dari keluarga Asfarviridae dan vulirus ini mudah berjangkit dalam kumpulan babi. Katanya, sebagai langkah keselamatan, pihaknya melakukan pemantauan di seluruh negeri ini sebagai langkah mencegah penularan penyakit terbabit.;Error

This brings to seven the total number of commercial pig farms with ASF cases, involving 25,000 pigs. Five of the affected farms are in Seberang Prai Selatan district and two are in Seberang Prai Tengah district. Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow said 929 pigs from the farm that first reported ASF cases had been culled and their carcasses buried onsite. All 25,000 pigs from the seven affected farms will be culled in stages to prevent the spread of ASF. The culling exercise may take weeks to complete. The Veterinary Services Department (DVS) will monitor the situation within a 5km radius from the affected farms to prevent the spread of ASF, he said in Perkampungan Valdor here today. He urged all pig farm operators to report all pig deaths so that testing can be carried out to prevent the situation from worsening. He said the ASF outbreak was confirmed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests conducted between Jan 4 and 12 on pig samples from the affected farms. To control and prevent the spread of ASF, the Penang DVS has implemented a stamping out policy to cull pigs in farms that have ASF cases. The culling is done with CO2 gas and done according to the Animal Welfare Code of Practice and Animal Disposal Management guidelines before the pigs are buried. The culling could not start earlier due to constraints in the area that will be used as a disposal site. Roadblocks have been mounted in roads leading to Perkampungan Valdor since Jan 10. Chow said this was done to control the movement of live pigs and pig carcasses from infected areas to control the spread of ASF.   Last September, two commercial pig farms in the Kerian district in Perak were hit by ASF. Last year, there were ASF outbreaks at 124 pig farms in Penang ‚Äî 64 in Seberang Prai Utara, 52 in Seberang Prai Selatan, four in Seberang Prai Tengah and four on the island ‚Äî involving a total of 267,348 pigs. The outbreak in Seberang Prai Selatan district alone involved 139,795 pigs. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, ASF has become a major crisis for the pork industry in recent years and is affecting several regions around the world. ASF is a highly contagious viral disease for domestic and wild pigs and the mortality rate can reach 100 per cent. The disease is not a danger to humans, but can have a devastating impact on pig populations and the farming industry. There is currently no effective vaccine against ASF.;Error

Currently, the number of pig farms affected by ASF comprises 18 in the South Seberang Perai district, two in Central Seberang Perai, four in North Seberang Perai, and three in Barat Daya, he told reporters in George Town today. He said transportation was among the factors behind the spread of the disease, and that 11,943 pigs from farms with confirmed cases had been culled so far. He said culling was still being carried out to contain the spread of the disease, with the pig carcasses buried in an area far from public settlements and without causing a public nuisance. The Penang Veterinary Services Department (JPV) also sent an application for compensation for 10 pig farms that have completed the disposal process, to the Veterinary Services headquarters in Putrajaya to be taken to the next level of action (federal government), he said. However, Chow said Penang would not face any shortages of pork as the state is an exporter of the meat to other states. He said based on a 2022 census by the Penang JPV, there are 124 pig farms in four districts in Penang with a pig population of 267,348. Penang still has more than 90 pig farms that have not been affected by ASF, and a shortage of pork in the market will not occur, he said. Chow said Penang has 170 officers from various agencies to manage the spread of the disease, and asked farmers and the public to immediately report any death of wild boars, village pigs or commercial pigs to the nearest district JPV or Penang Veterinary Services Office, or through the Penang JPV Disease Crisis Management Room hotline at 04-5041047.;Error

Its director Mohamad Hafid Rohani said the department's rangers were tracking down the tigers so they could be sent to the National Wildlife Rescue Centre (NWRC) in Perak. Based on our observation and from the sample of the tiger faeces taken, we suspect that the tigers might not be well, suffering from health problems or most probably infected by CDV as the result from the sample taken was positive.   This might cause the tigers to move within the 10 km radius in Pos Bihai, he said. Hafid said the department, however, could not confirm whether the virus had infected the three tigers being hunted by the department's rangers or other tigers. We believe the Gua Musang tiger case to be similar to the one in Terengganu last year. The virus will cause the animal to be confused and go against its predatory instincts. This may be the reason why it does not harm humans and livestock that come into its path and only takes food from garbage, he added. He also said the department had yet to confirm whether the tiger that mauled an Orang Asli man in Gua Musang recently was among the three tigers which were sighted in Pos Bihai and Pos Balar recently. Although the tiger that attacked the Orang Asli was shot dead, we believe there are still a few roaming in the two settlements of late, he added. Last week, a 59-year-old Orang Asli man, Anek Along, was mauled to death by a tiger at Kampung Sau near Pos Bihai, Gua Musang.;Error

Farmers were ordered to place the tested pigs under quarantine until the results are finalised, in line with Section 18(2) of the Animals Act 1953.Based on the results received on Jan 28 and Feb 4, pigs from two of the 29 farms tested positive for ASF. The sample collected from the active surveillance in Kampung Tumbuk on Feb 5 was also confirmed positive, he added.Izham also said that he has ordered Selangor DVS to take further action to curb the spread of ASF to other parts of the state.The Selangor government, through Selangor DVS, will take immediate action by collaborating with the police, district and land offices, the local authorities, and Public Works Department among other relevant agencies, he said.Izham also emphasised that ASF will not affect humans.ASF will only infect domestic and wild pigs, which will then die within two to 10 days.Pig farmers in Selangor are urged to be careful and step up the biosecurity of their farms to curb the spread of the virus.The public, especially players from the pig industry, are requested to immediately report any deaths of wild, village or commercial pigs to Selangor DVS at the district or state level.He also reminded the public not to spread any false information about ASF so as not to instil fear in the people.Thank you for your report!Copyright ¬© 1995-                                                $(document).ready(function () {                         var theDate = new Date();                        $('#spanCopyright').text(theDate.getFullYear())                    })                 Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)]Best viewed on Chrome browsers.We would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.
